# 📘 Bilingual Exercises – ESL Worksheet Generator v1.8

Generate **custom bilingual ESL worksheets** based on topics, grammar focus, and CEFR level — with instructions translated into the student's native language.

This prompt outputs **two ready-to-print `.docx` files**:
- 🧑‍🎓 `ESL_Worksheet_Student_by_Abner.docx` – Clean worksheet, no answers.
- 🧑‍🏫 `ESL_Worksheet_Teacher_by_Abner.docx` – Full answer key, example sentences, explanations, and dictation guide for ElevenLabs.

## 🧠 How It Works

The AI will ask the teacher:

1. What is the student's native language? (for translated instructions)
2. What is the target language of the exercises? (e.g., English)
3. What is the student’s CEFR level? (A1–C2)
4. What topic should the worksheet include? (e.g., work, culture)
5. Any topics to avoid?
6. What grammar point should be the focus? (e.g., Present Perfect, Simple Past)

Then it will generate 7 structured activities:
- Warm-up Question
- Grammar Explanation
- Sentence Builder
- Match the Columns (in table format)
- Fill in the Gaps
- Sentence Transformation (5 items)
- Dictation (with IPA + ElevenLabs guide)

All instructions and section titles will appear in the student’s native language.

## ⚠️ Possible Issues

Here are some known issues that may occur during execution:

1. **❌ DOCX files are not generated**  
   - Cause: Missing or malformed input (e.g., CEFR level or grammar point not entered)  
   - Fix: Make sure to answer each question clearly and avoid skipping

2. **📁 No download button appears**  
   - Cause: Some platforms may not support file downloads directly  
   - Fix: Manually access `/mnt/data/` or use the download link provided

3. **🌀 Prompt loop or freezes**  
   - Cause: Ambiguous answers (e.g., "anything" as a topic)  
   - Fix: Be specific when prompted for inputs

4. **🈳 Instructions appear in English instead of native language**  
   - Cause: The chosen native language is not fully mapped  
   - Fix: Stick to supported languages (e.g., Portuguese, Spanish, French, German)

5. **📄 Titles like "Warm-up" or "Match the Columns" not translated**  
   - Cause: Title rendering step failed or skipped  
   - Fix: Ensure that section headings are dynamically linked to `instruction_lang`

6. **📉 Table in "Match the Columns" not properly formatted**  
   - Cause: Attempting to format columns using plain text instead of actual table structure  
   - Fix: Always use a DOCX-compatible table, not spacing

7. **📤 File overwriting**  
   - Cause: Files with the same name are overwritten when the prompt runs multiple times  
   - Fix: Add timestamp or unique identifier to the filename
